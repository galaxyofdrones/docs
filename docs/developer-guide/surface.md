The planet infrastructure can be built on a 5 x 5 unit isometric grid, in the middle (green) of the Command Center. Depending on the size of the planet, there are 3, 4 or 5 minerals (blue) randomly. Buildable buildings can seen by clicking on the cell of the grid. The rendering is based on the [PixiJS](https://www.pixijs.com).
